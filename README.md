## 🧪 Project Summary
Patchy colloids are colloidal particles with engineered surface patches that enable
directional bonding and programmable self-assembly. In this project, I performed
**molecular dynamics simulations** to study how **patch ratio** and **packing fraction**
influence the self-assembly behavior of single-patch colloids.

### Key aspects
- Interactions modeled using **Weeks–Chandler–Andersen (WCA)** and **Morse potentials**
- Periodic boundary conditions applied in 3D simulation box
- Structural analysis carried out using **OVITO**
- Cluster distributions processed and visualized

### Main results
- **Patch ratio < 1.0** → micelle-like clusters dominate  
- **Patch ratio > 1.0** → dimers, trimers, and linear structures dominate  
- **Packing fraction** has limited effect except at higher densities  
- Large clusters are rare but appear across different parameter regions
